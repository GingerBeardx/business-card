        I am a self taught programmer that has been working as a software
        enginner for the past two years. I began my developer journey learning
        QBasic when I was in Jr. High and learned HTML when I was in high
        school. I pursued other interests as a career path until about 5 years
        ago when I started learning Python and learning the latest
        web-development techniques. Ultimately, I was able to get a position as
        a software enginner with the company I was working for. We utilize the
        .NET framework in our monolith software, but we have been transitioning
        our systems to a microservice environment that uses React, Postgress,
        and .NET Core.
